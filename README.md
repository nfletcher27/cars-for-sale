# first-django-webpage
# First webpage I've made using the Python web framework Django
## Used Django framework with Bootstrap navigation bar and card additions, and inline CSS for small formatting.
### The design is fairly crude but the main goal was to manage to get a webpage up and running with visuals, using Django
